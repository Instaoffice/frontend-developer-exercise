# frontend-developer-exercise
An exercise for frontend developer applicants
Please see the PDF for the flow of the applications. The assets are in the assets folder.

## The assignment
The user has to login using his username and password ( Validate with username - yoda, and password - dogbah ). Once logged in, the user is shown a collection of star wars characters.
The user can select one of them and see it's details which would lead to another page/view with all the details.


## Please note
The application should have the following architecture :

- Grunt/Gulp for managing the assets. Make sure that the assets files are minified
- Use LESS/SASS/Stylus for writing the CSS code.
- Do not use any CSS framework like Bootstrap etc. It's better to write it in the preprocessor
- You can use any javascript framework of your choice
- We are open to any architecture/pattern you follow.
- Bonus marks if you can improve upon the design/add crazy animations/make it smooth
